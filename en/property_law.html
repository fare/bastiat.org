<FONT SIZE="+3">Property and Law</FONT></P>

<P>The confidence of my fellow citizens has invested me with the
title of<I> legislator.</I></P>

<P>I should certainly have declined that title if I had understood it
as Rousseau did.</P>

<P>"Whoever ventures to undertake the founding of a nation," he
says,</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">should feel himself capable of changing human
nature, so to speak; of transforming each individual, who by himself
is a perfect and separate whole, into a part of a greater whole, from
which that individual somehow receives his life and his being; of
changing the physical constitution of man in order to strengthen it,
etc., etc ... If it be true that a great prince is a rarity, what,
then, is to be said of a great law- giver? The first has only to
follow the model that the other constructs. The latter is the
artificer who invents the machine; the former is only the operator
who turns it on and runs it.</FONT></P>

<P>Rousseau, being convinced that society is a human contrivance,
found it necessary to place law and the lawgiver on an extremely
lofty elevation. He saw between the lawgiver and the rest of mankind
as great a distance, or rather as great a gulf, as that which
separates the inventor of the machine from the inert matter of which
it is composed.</P>

<P>In his opinion, the law should transform persons and should create
or not create property. In my opinion, society, persons, and property
exist prior to the law, and--to restrict myself specifically to the
last of these--I would say: Property does not exist because there are
laws, but laws exist because there is property.</P>

<P>The opposition between these two systems is fundamental. Since the
consequences that follow from them keep eluding us, I hope I may be
permitted to make the question very precise. First, let me state that
I use the word<I> property</I> in the general sense, and not in the
limited sense of<I> landed property. I </I>regret, and probably all
economists regret with me, that this word involuntarily evokes in us
the idea of the possession of land. By<I> property I </I>understand
the right that the worker has to the value that he has created by his
labor.</P>

<P>Now, this much granted, I ask whether this right is created by,
law, or whether it is not, on the contrary, prior and superior to the
law; whether law is needed to give rise to the right to property, or
whether, on the contrary, property is a pre-existing fact and right
that gave rise to law. In the first case, it is the function of the
legislator to organize, modify, and even eliminate property if he
deems it good to do so; in the second, his jurisdiction is limited to
guaranteeing and safeguarding property rights.</P>

<P>In the preamble to a draft for a constitution, published by one of
the greatest thinkers of modern times, M. de Lamennais
<FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Felicite de Lamennais (1782-1854), French
philosopher, Catholic priest, reformer, and ardent champion of the
working classes.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> I find the following
words:</P>

<P>The French people declare that they recognize rights and duties
prior and superior to all positive laws and independent of them.</P>

<P>These rights and duties, emanating directly from God, are summed
up in the triple dogma which these sacred words express: Equality,
Liberty, Fraternity.</P>

<P>I ask whether the right to property is not one of those rights
which, far from springing from positive law, are prior to the law and
are the reason for its existence.</P>

<P>This is not, as might be thought, a theoretical and idle question.
It is of tremendous, of fundamental importance. Its solution concerns
society most urgently, and the reader will be convinced of this, I
hope, after I have compared the two systems in question in regard to
their origin and their consequences.</P>

<P>Economists believe that<I> property is </I>a providential fact,
like the human<I> person. </I>The law does not bring the one into
existence any more than it does the other. Property is a necessary
consequence of the nature of man.</P>

<P>In the full sense of the word, man <I>is born a proprietor,
</I>because he is born with wants whose satisfaction is necessary to
life, and with organs and faculties whose exercise is indispensable
to the satisfaction of these wants. Faculties are only an extension
of the person; and property is nothing but an extension of the
faculties. To separate a man from his faculties is to cause him to
die; to separate a man from the product of his faculties is likewise
to cause him to die.</P>

<P>There are some political theorists who are very much concerned
with knowing how God ought to have made man. We, for our part, study
man as God has made him. We observe that he cannot live without
providing for his wants, that he cannot provide for his wants without
labor, and that he will not perform any labor if he is not <I>sure
</I>of applying the fruit of his labor to the satisfaction of his
wants. That is why we believe that property has been divinely
instituted, and that the object of human law is its<I> protection
</I>or <I>security.</I></P>

<P>So true is it that <I>property is </I>prior to <I>law </I>that it
is recognized even among savages who do not have laws, or at least
not written laws. When a savage has devoted his labor to constructing
a hut, no one will dispute his possession or ownership of it. To be
sure, another, stronger savage may chase him out of it, but not
without angering and alarming the whole tribe. It is this very abuse
of force which gives rise to association, to common agreement, to
<I>law, </I>and which puts the public police force at the service of
property. Hence, law is born of property, instead of property being
born of law.</P>

<P>One may say that the principle of property is recognized even
among animals. The swallow peacefully cares for its young in the nest
that it has built by its own efforts.</P>

<P>Even plants live and develop by assimilation, by <I>appropriation.
</I>They<I> appropriate </I>the substances, the gases, the salts that
are within their reach. Any interruption in this process is all that
is needed to make them wither and die.</P>

<P>Man, too, lives and develops by<I> appropriation.
</I>Appropriation is a natural phenomenon, providential and essential
to life; and <I>property is </I>only appropriation that labor has
made a right. When labor has rendered substances <I>assimilable
</I>and <I>appropriable</I> that were not so before, I do not really
see how it can be alleged that, by right, the act of appropriation
should be performed for the benefit of another individual than the
one who has done the work.</P>

<P>It is because of these primordial facts, which are necessary
consequences of the very nature of man, that the law intervenes. As
the desire for life and self-development can induce the strong man to
despoil the weak, and thus to violate his right to the fruits of his
labor, it has been agreed that the combined force of all members of
society should be devoted to preventing and repressing violence. The
function of the law, then, is to safeguard the right to property. It
is not property that is a matter of agreement, but law.</P>

<P>Let us now seek for the origin of the opposing system.</P>

<P>All our past constitutions proclaim that <I>property is</I>
sacred, a fact that seems to indicate that the goal of social
organization is the free development of private associations or
individuals through their labor. This implies that the right to
property is prior to the law, since the sole object of the law would
be to protect <I>property.</I></P>

<P>But I wonder whether such a declaration has not been introduced
into our constitutions instinctively, so to speak, as a mere pious
phrase, as a dead letter, and whether, above all, it underlies all
our social convictions.</P>

<P>Now, if it is true, as has been said, that literature is the
expression of society, doubts may well be raised in this regard; for
never, certainly, have political theorists, after having respectfully
saluted the principle of property, invoked so much the intervention
of the law, not to safeguard property rights, but to modify, impair,
transform, balance, equalize, and organize property, credit, and
labor.</P>

<P>Now, this supposes that an absolute power over persons and
property is imputed to the law, and hence to the legislator.</P>

<P>This may distress us, but it should not surprise us.</P>

<P>Whence do we derive our ideas on these matters, and even our very
notion of <I>rights? </I>From Latin literature and Roman law.</P>

<P>I have not studied law, but it is sufficient for me to know that
the source of our theories is in Roman law, to affirm that they are
false. The Romans could not fail to consider property anything but a
purely conventional fact--a product, an artificial creation, of
written law. Evidently they could not go back, as political economy
does, to the very nature of man and perceive the relations and
necessary connections that exist among wants, faculties, labor, and
property. It would have been absurd and suicidal for them to have
done so. How could they, when they lived by looting, when all their
property was the fruit of plunder, when they had based their whole
way of life on the labor of slaves; how could they, without
shattering the foundations of their society, introduce into their
legislation the idea that the true title to property is the labor
that produces it? No, they could neither say it nor think it. They
had to have recourse to a purely empirical definition of
property -- <I>jus utendi et abutendi</I>
<FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;"The right to use and abuse.-- TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT>
-- a definition that refers only to effects and not to causes or origins,
for they were indeed forced to conceal the latter from view.</P>

<P>It is sad to think that the science of law as we know it in the
nineteenth century is still based on principles formulated in
antiquity to justify slavery; but this is easily explained. The
teaching of law is monopolized in France, and monopoly excludes
progress. It is true that jurists do not create all of public
opinion; but it must be said that university and clerical education
prepares French youth marvelously to accept the false ideas of
jurists on these matters, since, the better to assure this, it
plunges all of us, during the ten best years of our lives, in the
atmosphere of war and slavery that enveloped and permeated Roman
society.</P>

<P>Do not be surprised, then, to see reproduced in the eighteenth
century the Roman idea that property is a matter of convention and of
legal institution; that, far from law being a corollary of property,
it is property that is a corollary of law. We know that, for
Rousseau, not only property but the whole of society was the result
of a contract, of an <I>invention, </I>a product of the legislator's
mind.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The social order is a sacred right that serves as
the basis of all the others. However, this right <I>does not come
from Nature. </I>Therefore, it is founded on<I>
convention.</I></FONT></P>

<P>Thus, the right that serves as the basis of all the others is
purely<I> conventional. </I>Hence, <I>property, </I>which is a
subsequent right, is also<I> conventional. It does not come from
Nature.</I></P>

<P>Robespierre was imbued with the ideas of Rousseau. In what the
disciple says about property, we recognize the theories and even the
rhetorical forms of the master.</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Citizens, I propose to you first a few necessary
articles to complete our theory of <I>property. </I>Let this word
alarm no one. You sordid souls, who esteem only gold, do not be
frightened; I do not wish to lay hands on your treasures, however
impure their source ... For my part, I would rather be born in the
hut of Fabricius than in the palace of Lucullus, etc.,
etc.</FONT></P>

<P>Here it should be noted that, when one analyzes the notion of
property, it is irrational and dangerous to treat this term as
synonymous with opulence, and, even worse, with ill-gotten opulence.
The hut of Fabricius <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Gaius Luscinus Fabricius,
distinguished Roman general and consul whose integrity so impressed
Pyrrhus when he was sent as an ambassador to treat for the ransom and
exchange of prisoners in 280 B.C. that they were released without
ransom. He died so poor that the state had to provide for his
daughter.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> is property just as much as the
palace of Lucullus. <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Lucius Licinius Lucullus
(110-56 B.C.), Roman general and plutocrat famous for the
sumptuousness and elegance of his mode of life and especially for his
extravagant gourmet meals.-- TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> But let me call
the reader's attention to the following words, which sum up the whole
system:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">In defining freedom, man's primary need, the most
sacred of his <I>natural</I> rights, we have said, quite correctly,
that it has as its limit the rights of others. Why have you not
applied this principle to property,<I> which is socially instituted,
</I>as if the eternal laws of Nature were less inviolable than the<I>
conventions </I>of men?</FONT></P>

<P>After these introductory remarks, Robespierre formulates his
principles in these terms:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Art. 1. Property is the right that each citizen
has to enjoy and to dispose of the portion of goods that is
guaranteed to him <I>by law.</I></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Art. 2. The right to property is limited, as are
all others, by the obligation to respect the rights of
others.</FONT></P>

<P>Thus, Robespierre sets up an opposition between<I> liberty </I>and
<I>property.</I> These are two rights of different origin: one comes
from Nature; the other is socially instituted. The first is
<I>natural; </I>the second, <I>conventional.</I></P>

<P>The fact that Robespierre imposes identical limits on these two
rights should have led him, it would seem, to think that they come
from the same source. Whether liberty or property is in question, to
respect the right of others is not to destroy or impair the right,
but rather to recognize and confirm it. It is precisely because
property as well as liberty is a right prior to the law that both
exist only on condition of respecting the like right of others, and
it is the function of the law to see that this limit is respected,
which means to recognize and support this very principle.</P>

<P>In any case, it is certain that Robespierre, following Rousseau's
example, considered property as a social institution, as a
convention. He did not connect it at all with its true justification,
which is labor. It is the right, he said, to dispose of the portion
of goods <I>guaranteed by law.</I></P>

<P>I do not need to recall here that through Rousseau and Robespierre
the Roman idea of property has been transmitted to all our
self-styled socialist schools of thought. We know that the first
volume of Louis Blanc, on the Revolution, is a dithyramb to the
philosopher of Geneva and to the leader of the Convention.</P>

<P>Thus, this idea that the right to property is socially instituted,
that it is an invention of the legislator, a creation of the law--in
other words, that it is unknown to men in the <I>state of
nature--</I> has been transmitted from the Romans down to us, through
the teaching of law, classical studies, the political theorists of
the eighteenth century, the revolutionaries of 1793, and the modem
proponents of a planned social order.</P>

<P>Let us now proceed to consider the consequences of the two systems
that I have just placed in opposition. Let us begin with the legal
system. The first result is to open an unlimited field to the
imagination of the utopians.</P>

<P>This is obvious. Once it is accepted in principle that property
derives its existence from the law, there are as many possible ways
of organizing labor as there are possible laws in the heads of
dreamers. Once it is accepted in principle that it is the
responsibility of the legislator to arrange, combine, and form
persons and property in any way he pleases, there are no limits to
the imaginable ways in which persons and property can be arranged,
combined, and formed. At this moment, there are certainly five
hundred proposals in circulation in Paris for the organization of
labor, without counting an equal number of proposals for the
organization of credit. Undoubtedly, these plans are mutually
contradictory, but all have in common this underlying thought: it is
the law that creates the right to property; it is the legislator who
disposes of the workers and the fruits of their labor as an absolute
master.</P>

<P>Among these proposals, the ones that have attracted the most
public attention are those of Fourier, Saint-Simon, Owen, Cabet, and
Louis Blanc. But it would be absurd to believe that these five modes
of organization are the only ones possible. There are an unlimited
number of them. Each morning a new one may appear, more seductive
than that of the day before, and I leave it to your imagination to
envision what would become of mankind if, as soon as one of these
plans were imposed on us, another more plausible were suddenly to
make its appearance. Mankind would be reduced to the alternative
either of changing its mode of life every morning, or of persevering
forever along a road recognized as false, simply because it had
already been entered upon.</P>

<P>A second result is to arouse in all these dreamers a thirst for
power. Suppose I conceive of a system for the organization of labor.
To set forth my system and wait for men to adopt it if it is good,
would be to assume that the initiative lies with them. But in the
system that I am examining, the initiative lies with the legislator.
"The legislator," as Rousseau says, "should feel strong enough to
transform human nature." Hence, what I should aspire to is to become
a legislator, in order to impose on mankind a social order of my own
invention.</P>

<P>Moreover, it is clear that the systems which are based on the idea
that the right to property is socially instituted all end either in
the most concentrated privilege or in complete communism, depending
upon the evil or good intentions of the inventor. If his purposes are
sinister, he will make use of the law to enrich a few at the expense
of all. If he is philanthropically inclined, he will try to equalize
the standard of living, and, to that end, he will devise some means
of assuring everyone a legal claim to an equal share in whatever is
produced. It remains to be seen whether, in that case, it is possible
to produce anything at all.</P>

<P>In this regard, the Luxembourg <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;The
meeting-place of the National Assembly.-- TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> has
recently presented us with a most extraordinary spectacle. Did we not
hear, right in the middle of the nineteenth century, a few days after
the February Revolution (a revolution made in the name of liberty) a
man, more than a cabinet minister, actually a member of the
provisional government, a public official vested with revolutionary
and unlimited authority, coolly inquire whether in the allotment of
wages it was good to consider the strength, the talent, the
industriousness, the capability of the worker, that is, the wealth he
produced; or whether, in disregard of these personal virtues or of
their useful effect, it would not be better to give everyone
henceforth a uniform remuneration? This is tantamount to asking: Will
a yard of cloth brought to market by an idler sell at the same price
as two yards offered by an industrious man? And, what passes all
belief, this same individual proclaimed that he would prefer profits
to be uniform, whatever the quality or the quantity of the product
offered for sale, and he therefore decided in his wisdom that,
although<I> two </I>are <I>two </I>by nature, they are to be no more
than <I>one </I>by<I> law.</I></P>

<P>This is where we get when we start from the assumption that the
law is stronger than nature.</P>

<P>Those whom he addressed apparently understood that such
arbitrariness is repugnant to the very nature of man, that one yard
of cloth could never be made to give the right to the same
remuneration as two yards. In such a case, the competition that was
to be abolished would be replaced by another competition a thousand
times worse: each worker would strive to be the one who worked the
least, who exerted himself the least, since, by law, the wage would
always be guaranteed and would be the same for all.</P>

<P>But Citizen <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;This title of address used during
the French Revolution has. of course, an ironic connotation here,
much like the term "Comrade" in our time.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT>
Blanc had foreseen this objection, and, to prevent this<I> dolce far
niente so </I>natural in man, alas! when his work is not remunerated,
he thought of the idea of erecting in each community a <I>post
</I>where the names of the idlers would be inscribed. But he did not
say whether there would be inquisitors to spy out the sin of
laziness, tribunals to judge it, and police to carry out the
sentence. It is to be noted that the utopians are never concerned
with the vast governmental apparatus that alone can set their legal
mechanism in motion. When the delegates of the Luxembourg appeared a
bit incredulous, up strode Citizen Vidal,
<FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Francois Vidal (1814-1872), journalist,
politician, and writer on economic subjects. An ardent advocate of
government intervention in the relations between labor and capital,
he edited a number of publications, including <I>La Presse. </I>After
the Revolution of 1848, Louis Blanc made him secretary of the
commission for the organization of labor. He later took an active
part in the political opposition to Louis Bonaparte. His most famous
work, to which Bastiat's French editor makes reference on p. 327<I>
infra, </I>is entitled <I>De la repartition de richesses ou De la
justice distributive en economic sociale</I> (1846). It <I>is </I>a
critical examination of the economic doctrines of his
day.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> the secretary of Citizen Blanc, to add
the finishing touches to the thought of the master. Following
Rousseau's example, Citizen Vidal proposed nothing less than to
change human nature and the laws of Providence.2</P>

<P>It has pleased Providence to give to every individual certain
<I>wants</I> and their consequences, as well as certain <I>faculties
</I>and their consequences, thus creating <I>self-interest,
</I>otherwise known as the instinct for self- preservation and the
desire for self-development, as the great motive force of mankind. M.
Vidal is going to change all this. He has looked at the work of God,
and he has seen that it was not good. Consequently, proceeding from
the principle that the law and the legislator can do everything, he
is going to suppress <I>self-interest</I> by decree. He substitutes
for it the <I>code of honor. </I>It is no longer in order to live or
to raise and support their families that men are to work, but to
maintain their <I>honor,</I> to avoid the fatal <I>post, </I>as if
this new motive were not again <I>self-interest</I> of another
sort.</P>

<OL>
   <LI>Vidal keeps incessantly citing what adherence to a code of
   honor has made armies do. But, alas! let him tell us the whole
   truth, and if his plan is to regiment the workers, let him say,
   then, whether martial law, with its thirty crimes punishable by
   death, is to become the code of labor.</LI>
</OL>

<P>An even more striking effect of the harmful principle that I am
here seeking to combat is the uncertainty that it always holds
suspended, like the sword of Damocles, over labor, capital, commerce,
and industry; and this is so serious that I venture to ask the reader
to give his full attention to it.</P>

<P>In a country like the United States, where the right to property
is placed above the law, where the sole function of the public police
force is to safeguard this natural right, each person can in full
confidence dedicate his capital and his labor to production. He does
not have to fear that his plans and calculations will be upset from
one instant to another by the legislature.</P>

<P>But when, on the contrary, acting on the principle that not labor,
but the law, is the basis of property, we permit the makers of
utopias to impose their schemes on us in a general way and by decree,
who does not see that all the foresight and prudence that Nature has
implanted in the heart of man is turned against industrial
progress?</P>

<P>Where, at such a time, is the bold speculator who would dare set
up a factory or engage in an enterprise? Yesterday it was decreed
that he will be permitted to work only for a fixed number of hours.
Today it is decreed that the wages of a certain type of labor will be
fixed. Who can foresee tomorrow's decree, that of the day after
tomorrow, or those of the days following? Once the legislator is
placed at this incommensurable distance from other men, and believes,
in all conscience, that he can dispose of their time, their labor,
and their transactions, all of which are their <I>property,</I> what
man in the whole country has the least knowledge of the position in
which the law will forcibly place him and his line of work tomorrow?
And, under such conditions, who can or will undertake anything?</P>

<P>I certainly do not deny that among the innumerable systems that
this false principle gives rise to, a great number, the greater
number even, originate from benevolent and generous intentions. But
what is vicious is the principle itself. The manifest end of each
particular plan is to equalize prosperity. But the still more
manifest result of the principle on which these plans are founded is
to equalize poverty; nay more, the effect is to force the well-to-do
families down into the ranks of the poor and to decimate the families
of the poor by sickness and starvation.</P>

<P>I confess that I fear for the future of my country when I think of
the seriousness of the financial difficulties that this dangerous
principle will aggravate still further.</P>

<P>On February 24, we found that we had a budget that exceeds the
income that France can reasonably attain; and, beyond that, according
to the present Minister of Finance, nearly a billion francs worth of
debts payable immediately on demand.</P>

<P>In this situation, already so alarming, the expenses have been
continually increasing, and the receipts constantly decreasing.</P>

<P>Nor is this all. The public has been deluged, with an unlimited
prodigality, by two sorts of promises. According to one, a vast
number of charitable, but costly, institutions are to be established
at public expense. According to the other, all taxes are going to be
reduced. Thus, on the one hand, nurseries, asylums, free primary and
secondary schools, workshops, and industrial retirement pensions are
going to be multiplied. Slave owners are going to be paid
indemnities, and the slaves themselves are to be paid damages; the
state is going to found credit institutions, lend to workers the
tools of production, double the size of the army, reorganize the
navy, etc., etc., and, on the other hand, it will abolish the tax on
salt, tolls, and all the most unpopular excises.</P>

<P>Certainly, whatever idea one may have of France's resources, it
will at least be admitted that these resources must be developed in
order to be adequate for this double enterprise, so gigantic and
apparently so contradictory.</P>

<P>But here, in the midst of this extraordinary movement, which may
be considered as above the power of man to accomplish, at the same
time as all the energies of the country are being directed toward
productive labor, a cry arises: <I>The right to property is a
creation of the law. </I>Consequently, the legislator can promulgate
at any time, in accordance with whatever theories he has come to
accept, decrees that may upset all the calculations of industry. The
worker is not the owner of a thing or of a value because he has
created it by his labor, but because today's law guarantees it.
Tomorrow's law can withdraw this guarantee, and then the ownership is
no longer legitimate.</P>

<P>What must be the consequence of all this? Capital and labor will
be frightened; they will no longer be able to count on the future.
Capital, under the impact of such a doctrine, will hide, flee, be
destroyed. And what will become, then, of the workers, those workers
for whom you profess an affection so deep and sincere, but so
unenlightened? Will they be better fed when agricultural production
is stopped? Will they be better dressed when no one dares to build a
factory? Will they have more employment when capital will have
disappeared?</P>

<P>And from what source will you derive the taxes? And how will you
replenish the treasury? How will you pay the army? How will you meet
your debts? With what money will you furnish the tools of production?
With what resources will you support these charitable institutions,
so easy to establish by decree?</P>

<P>I hasten to turn aside from these dreary considerations. It
remains for me to examine the consequences of the principle opposed
to that which prevails today, the economist's principle, the
principle that derives the right to property from labor, and not from
the law, the principle which says: Property is prior to law; the sole
function of the law is to safeguard the right to property wherever it
exists, wherever it is formed, in whatever manner the worker produces
it, whether individually or in association, provided that he respects
the rights of others.</P>

<P>First, whereas the jurists' principle involves virtual slavery,
the economists' principle implies <I>liberty. </I>Property, the right
to enjoy the fruits of one's labor, the right to work, to develop, to
exercise one's faculties, according to one's own understanding,
without the state intervening otherwise than by its protective
action--this is what is meant by liberty. And I still cannot
understand why the numerous partisans of the systems opposed to
liberty allow the word <I>liberty </I>to remain on the flag of the
Republic. To be sure, a few of them have effaced it in order to
substitute the word<I> solidarity. </I>They are more honest and more
logical. But they should have said <I>communism,</I> and not
<I>solidarity; </I>for the solidarity of men's interests, like
property, exists outside the purview of the law.</P>

<P>Moreover, it implies <I>unity. </I>This we have already seen. If
the legislator creates the right to property, there are as many modes
of property as there can be errors in the utopians' heads, that is,
an infinite number. If, on the contrary, the right to property is a
providential fact, prior to all human legislation, and which it is
the function of human legislation to safeguard, there is no place for
any other system.</P>

<P>Beyond this, there is<I> security; </I>and all evidence clearly
indicates that, if people sincerely recognize the obligation of every
person to provide his own means of existence, as well as every
person's right to the fruits of his own labor as prior and superior
to the law, if human law is needed and intervenes only to guarantee
to all the freedom to engage in labor and the ownership of its
fruits, then all human industry is assured a future of complete
security. There is no longer reason to fear that the legislature may,
with one decree after another, stifle effort, upset plans, frustrate
foresight. Under the shelter of such security, capital will rapidly
be created. The rapid accumulation of capital, in turn, is the sole
reason for the increase in the value of labor. The working classes
will, then, be well off; they themselves will co-operate to form new
capital. They will be better able to rise from the status of wage
earners, to invest in business enterprises, to found enterprises of
their own, and to regain their dignity.</P>

<P>Finally, the eternal principle that the state should not be a
producer, but the provider of security for the producers, necessarily
involves economy and order in public finances; consequently, this
principle alone renders prosperity possible and a just distribution
of taxes.</P>

<P>Let us never forget that, in fact, the state has no resources of
its own. It has nothing, it possesses nothing that it does not take
from the workers. When, then, it meddles in everything, it
substitutes the deplorable and costly activity of its own agents for
private activity. If, as in the United States, it came to be
recognized that the function of the state is to provide complete
<I>security </I>for all, it could fulfill this function with a few
hundred million francs. Thanks to this economy, combined with
industrial prosperity, it would finally be possible to impose a
single direct tax, levied exclusively on <I>property </I>of all
kinds.</P>

<P>But, for that, we must wait until we have learned by experience
--perhaps cruel experience--to trust in the state a little less and
in mankind a little more.</P>

<P>I shall conclude with a few words on the Association for Free
Trade. <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;In 1846, Bastiat helped to organize the
first Association for Free Trade in Bordeaux, and soon thereafter he
was named secretary of a similar association established in
Paris.--TRANSLATOR&#93;</FONT> It has been very much criticized for
having adopted this name. Its adversaries have rejoiced, and its
supporters have been distressed, by what both consider as a
defect.</P>

<P>"Why spread alarm in this way?" said its supporters. "Why inscribe
a<I> principle </I>on your banner? Why not limit yourself to
demanding those wise and prudent changes in the customs duties that
time has rendered necessary and experience has shown to be
expedient?"</P>

<P>Why? Because, in my eyes at least, free trade has never been a
question of customs duties, but a question of right, of justice, of
public order, of property. Because privilege, under whatever form it
is manifested, implies the denial or the scorn of property rights;
because the intervention of the state to equalize wealth, to increase
the share of some at the expense of others, is <I>communism, </I>as a
drop of water is just as much water as the whole ocean; because I
foresaw that the right to property, once weakened in one form, would
soon be attacked in a thousand different forms; because I had not
given up my solitude in order to work for a mere reduction in customs
duties, which would have implied my adherence to the false idea<I>
that the law is prior to property, </I>but to fly to the rescue of
the opposite principle, compromised by the protectionist system;
because I was convinced that the landed proprietors and the
capitalists had themselves implanted, in the tariff, the seed of that
<I>communism</I> which now frightens them, since they asked <I>the
law </I>for additions to their profits, to the detriment of the
working classes. I saw clearly that these classes would not delay in
claiming also, by virtue of equality, the benefit of the<I> law for
the equalization of wealth, </I>which is <I>communism.</I></P>

<P>If our critics will but read the first statement issued by our
Association, the program drafted at a preliminary session, May 10,
1846, they will be convinced that this was our dominating idea:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">Exchange, like property, is a natural right. Every
citizen who has produced or acquired a product should have the option
of applying it immediately to his own use or of giving it to whoever
on the face of the earth consents to give him in exchange the object
of his desires. To deprive him of this faculty, when he has committed
no act contrary to public order and good morals, and solely to
satisfy the convenience of another citizen, is to legitimize an act
of plunder and to violate the law of justice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">It is, further, to violate the conditions of
public order; for what order can exist in a society in which each
industry, aided and abetted by the law and the public police force,
seeks its success in the oppression of all the others?</FONT></P>

<P>We placed the question so far above customs duties that we
added:</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">The undersigned do not contest the right of
society to levy on the merchandise that crosses its borders taxes
reserved for the common expense, provided that they are determined
solely by the needs of the public treasury.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">But as soon as the tax, losing its fiscal
character, has for its object the exclusion of a foreign product, to
the detriment of the treasury itself, in order to raise artificially
the price of a similar domestic product, and to exact tribute from
the community for the profit of one class, from that moment
protection, or rather plunder, makes its appearance, and <I>this is
</I>the principle that the Association seeks to discredit and to
efface completely from our laws.</FONT></P>

<P>Certainly, if we had been working only for an immediate reduction
in customs duties, if we had been, as has been alleged, the agents of
certain commercial interests, we should have been very careful not to
inscribe on our banner a word that implies a principle. Is it
supposed that I did not foresee the obstacles that this declaration
of war against injustice would place in our path? Did I not know very
well that by evasive maneuvering, by hiding our aim, by veiling half
our thought, we should the sooner achieve such or such a partial
victory? But just how would these triumphs, actually ephemeral, have
redeemed and safeguarded the great principle of property rights,
which in that case we should ourselves have kept in the background
and out of the discussion?</P>

<P>I repeat, we asked for the abolition of the protectionist system,
not as a good governmental measure, but as an act of justice, as the
realization of liberty, as the strict consequence of a right superior
to the law. We should not conceal what we really want under a
misleading form of expression.3</P>

<P>The time is coming when it will be recognized that we were right
not to consent to put into the name of our Association a lure, a
trap, a surprise, an equivocation, but rather the frank expression of
an eternal principle of order and justice; for there is power only in
principles: they alone are a beacon light for men's minds, a rallying
point for convictions gone astray. In recent times, a universal
tremor has spread, like a shiver of fright, through all of France. At
the mere mention of the word <I>communism</I> everyone becomes
alarmed. Seeing the strangest systems emerge openly and almost
officially, witnessing a continual succession of subversive decrees,
and fearing that these may be followed by decrees even more
subversive, everyone is wondering in what direction we are going.
Capital is frightened, credit has taken flight, work has been
suspended, the saw and the hammer have stopped in the midst of their
labor, as if a disastrous electric current had suddenly paralyzed all
men's minds and hands. And why? Because the right to property,
already essentially compromised by the protectionist system, has been
subjected to new shocks consequent upon the first one; because the
intervention of the law in matters of industry, <I>as a means of
stabilizing values and equilibrating incomes, </I>an intervention of
which the protectionist system has been the first known
manifestation, now threatens to manifest itself in a thousand forms,
known or unknown. Yes, I say it openly: it is the landowners, those
who are considered property owners par excellence, who have
undermined property rights, since they have appealed<I> to the law
</I>to give an artificial value to their lands and their products. It
is the capitalists who have suggested the idea of equalizing
wealth<I> by law. Protectionism </I>has been the forerunner of
<I>communism; I</I> say more: it has been its first manifestation.
For what do the suffering classes demand today? They ask for nothing
else than what the capitalists and landlords have demanded and
obtained. They ask for the <I>intervention of the law </I>to achieve
balance, equilibrium, equality in the distribution of wealth. What
has been done in the first case by means of the tariff, they wish to
do by other means, but the principle remains the same: <I>Use the law
to take from some to give to others; </I>and certainly since it is
you, landowners and capitalists, who have had this disastrous
principle accepted, do not complain, then, if people less fortunate
than you are claim its benefits. They at least have a claim to it
that you do not.4</P>

<P>But finally people's eyes are beginning to open, and they see the
nature of the abyss toward which we are being driven because of this
first violation of the conditions essential to all social stability.
Is it not a terrible lesson, a tangible proof of the existence of
that chain of causes and effects whereby the justice of providential
retribution ultimately becomes apparent, to see the rich terrified
today by the inroads made by a false doctrine of which they
themselves laid the iniquitous foundations, and whose consequences
they believed they could quietly turn to their own profit? Yes,
protectionists, you have been the promoters of communism. Yes,
property owners, you have destroyed the true idea of property in our
minds. It was political economy that gave us this idea, and you have
proscribed political economy, because in the name of the right to
property it opposes your unjust privileges.6 And when the adherents
of these new schools of thought that frighten you came to power, what
was the first thing they tried to do? To suppress political economy,
for political economy is a perpetual protest against the <I>legal
leveling </I>which you have sought, and which others, following your
example, seek today. You have demanded of the law something other and
more than should be asked of the law, something other and more than
the law can give. You have asked of it, not security (that would have
been your right), but a <I>surplus value</I> over and above what
belongs to you, which could not be accorded to you without violating
the rights of others. And now, the folly of your claims has become a
universal folly. And if you wish to ward off the storm that threatens
to destroy you, you have only one recourse left. Recognize your
error; renounce your privileges; let the law return to its proper
sphere, and restrict the legislator to his proper role. You have
abandoned us, you have attacked us, because you undoubtedly did not
understand us. Now that you perceive the abyss that you have opened
with your own hands, hasten to join us in our defense of the right to
property by giving to this term its broadest possible meaning and
showing that it includes both man's faculties and all that his
faculties can produce, whether by labor or by exchange.</P>

<P>The doctrine which we are defending arouses a certain opposition
because of its extreme simplicity; it confines itself to demanding of
the law <I>security</I> for all. People can scarcely believe that the
machinery of government can be reduced to these proportions.
Moreover, as this doctrine restricts the<I> law </I>to the limits of
<I>universal justice</I>, it is reproached for excluding fraternity.
Political economy does not accept this accusation. This will be the
subject of a forthcoming article.</P>

<P>The economist school is opposed, on many points, to the numerous
socialist schools, which call themselves more <I>advanced, </I>and
which are, I readily agree, more active and more popular. We have as
adversaries (I do not want to say, detractors) the Communists,
<FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Writing before the time of Karl Marx, Bastiat
uses this term, of course, to designate generally those political
theorists, like the others whose names follow, who advocated
collectivism as a means to advance equality.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT>
the Fourierists, the Owenists, Cabet, Louis Blanc, Proudhon, Pierre
Leroux <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Pierre Leroux (1797-1871), French
philosopher, publisher, and encyclopedist, a disciple of Saint -
Simon. Editor of <I>Le Globe.</I> --TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> and many
others.</P>

<P>What is peculiar is that these schools differ among themselves at
least as much as they differ with us. Hence, they must, in the first
place, accept one principle in common that we do not accept; next,
this principle must lend itself to the infinite diversity that we see
among them.</P>

<P>I believe that what separates us radically from them is this:</P>

<P>Political economy is resolved to ask <I>of the law </I>nothing but
universal justice.</P>

<P>Socialism, in its various forms and applications, the number of
which is naturally indefinite, demands <I>of the law</I> , in
addition, the realization of the principle of fraternity.</P>

<P>Now, what is the result? The socialists presuppose, with Rousseau,
that the law is the foundation of the entire social order. As we
know, Rousseau makes society rest on a contract. Louis Blanc, on the
very first page of his book on the Revolution, says:</P>

<P>The principle of fraternity is that which, regarding the members
of the great family of man as jointly and separately answerable for
one another, looks forward to the day when society, <I>the work of
man, is </I>organized on the model of the human body, the work of
God.</P>

<P>Starting from this premise, that society is <I>the work of man,
</I>the work of the law, the socialists cannot fail to conclude that
nothing exists in society that was not ordained and arranged in
advance by the legislator</P>

<P>Hence, seeing that political economy confines itself to demanding
of the law justice everywhere and for all, i.e., universal justice,
they thought that it did not admit fraternity in social
relations.</P>

<P>Their reasoning is strictly logical. "Since the social order is
based entirely on the law," they said, "and since you demand only
justice from the law, you exclude fraternity from the law and,
consequently, from society."</P>

<P>Hence the accusations of rigidity, of coldness, of hardness, of
dryness, that have been heaped on economic science and on those who
teach it or accept its teachings.</P>

<P>But is the major premise admissible? Is it true that the social
order is based entirely on the law? It is immediately apparent that
if this is not so, all these accusations are left without any
support.</P>

<P>We say that positive law, which always acts with authority, by way
of compulsion, supported by coercive power, its penalties enforced by
the bayonet and the jail, decrees neither affection nor friendship
nor love nor self-denial nor devotion nor sacrifice. Hence, it
cannot, by the same token, decree that which sums them all up,
namely, fraternity. Is to say this, then, to annihilate or deny these
noble attributes of our nature? Certainly not; it is only to say that
society is larger than the law; that a great number of acts are
performed, that a great many feelings are stirred, beyond and above
the law.</P>

<P>For my part, I protest, in the name of science, with all my power
against this wretched interpretation, according to which, because we
recognize that the law has a limit, we are accused of denying
everything that lies beyond that limit. We too, believe us, are
filled with fervent emotion when we hear the word <I>fraternity</I> ,
handed down eighteen centuries ago from the top of the holy mountain
and inscribed forever on our republican flag. We too desire to see
individuals, families, nations associate with one another, aid one
another, relieve one another in the painful journey of mortal life.
We too feel our hearts stir and our tears welling up at the recital
of noble deeds, whether they add lustre to the lives of simple
citizens, join different classes together in close union, or
accelerate the onward movement of nations chosen by destiny to occupy
the advanced outposts of progress and civilization.</P>

<P>Are we to be reduced to speaking of ourselves? In that case, let
our actions be subjected to close scrutiny. Certainly we should like
very much to grant that the numerous political theorists who in our
day wish to stifle even the feeling of self - interest in men's
hearts, who appear so pitiless toward what they call individualism,
who incessantly repeat the words "devotion," "sacrifice,"
"fraternity," are themselves actuated exclusively by those sublime
motives that they recommend to others, that they practice what they
preach, that they have been careful to put their own conduct into
harmony with their doctrines. We should indeed like to take them at
their word and believe that they are full of disinterestedness and
charity; but, in the last analysis, we may venture to say that we do
not fear comparison in this regard.</P>

<P>Every would-be Decius <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Publius Decius Mus,
father and son, both military leaders of the Roman Republic between
350 and 275 B.C., are said to have performed acts of self-devotion by
hurling themselves into the midst of the enemy when the Roman column
each was leading was repulsed.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT>among them has
a plan designed to make mankind happy, and they all have the air of
saying that if we oppose them, it is because we fear either for our
property or for other social advantages. No; we oppose them because
we consider their ideas to be false, because we believe their
proposals to be as naive as they are disastrous. If we could be shown
that happiness could be brought forever down to earth by an
artificial social organization, or by decreeing fraternity, there are
some among us, even though we are economists, who would gladly sign
that decree with the last drop of their blood.</P>

<P>But we have not been shown that fraternity can be imposed. If,
indeed, wherever it appears, it excites our sympathy so keenly, that
is because it acts outside of all legal constraint. Either fraternity
is spontaneous, or it does not exist. To decree it is to annihilate
it. <I>The law </I>can indeed <I>force </I>men to remain just; in
vain would it try to<I> force</I> them to be self-sacrificing.</P>

<P>It is not I, moreover, who have invented this distinction. As I
have just said, eighteen centuries ago these words were uttered by
the divine Founder of our religion:</P>

<P><I>The law says unto you: Do not do unto others what you would not
have done unto you.</I></P>

<P><I>And I say unto you: Do unto others what you would have others
do unto you.</I></P>

<P>I believe that these words fix the limit that separates justice
from fraternity. I believe that they trace, besides, a line of
demarcation, I will not say absolute and unbridgeable, but
theoretical and rational, between the domain circumscribed by the law
and the limitless region of human spontaneity.</P>

<P>When a great number of families, all of whom, whether in isolation
or in association, need to work in order to live, to prosper, and to
better themselves, pool some of their forces, what can they demand of
this common force save the protection of all persons, all products of
labor, all property, all rights, all interests? Is this anything else
than universal justice? Evidently, the right of each is limited by
the absolutely similar right of all the others. The law, then, can do
no more than recognize this limit and see that it is respected. If it
were to permit a few to infringe this limit, this would be to the
detriment of others. The law would be unjust. It would be still more
so if, instead of tolerating this encroachment, it ordered it.</P>

<P>Suppose property is involved, for example. The principle is that
what each has produced by his labor belongs to him, the more so as
this labor has been comparatively more or less skillful, continuous,
successful, and, consequently, more or less productive. What if two
workers wish to unite their forces, to share the common product
according to mutually agreed-upon terms, or to exchange their
products between them, or if one should make a loan or a gift to the
other? What has this to do with the law? Nothing, it seems to me, if
the law has only to require the fulfillment of contracts and to
prevent or punish misrepresentation, violence, and fraud.</P>

<P>Does this mean that it forbids acts of self-sacrifice and
generosity? Who could have such an idea? But will it go so far as to
order them? This is precisely the point that divides economists from
socialists. If the socialists mean that under extraordinary
circumstances, for urgent cases, the state should set aside some
resources to assist certain unfortunate people, to help them adjust
to changing conditions, we will, of course, agree. This is done now;
we desire that it be done better. There is, however, a point on this
road that must not be passed; it is the point where governmental
foresight would step in to replace individual foresight and thus
destroy it. It is quite evident that organized charity would, in this
case, do much more permanent harm than temporary good.</P>

<P>But we are not concerned here with exceptional measures. What we
are inquiring into is this: Is it the function of the law, considered
from a general and theoretical point of view, to declare the limits
of <I>pre-existing </I>reciprocal rights and to see that they are
respected, or, instead, to make men happy directly by compelling acts
of charity, self-abnegation, and mutual sacrifice?</P>

<P>What strikes me most forcibly in this latter system (and it is for
this reason that I often return to it in this hastily written essay),
is the uncertainty in which it leaves all human activity and its
results, the unknown factor with which it confronts society, an
unknown that has the power to paralyze all its forces.</P>

<P>One knows what justice is, and where it is. It is a fixed,
immutable point. If the law takes justice as its guide, everyone
knows what to hold fast to and acts accordingly.</P>

<P>But at what definite point is fraternity to be situated? What is
its limit? What is its form? Evidently, it is infinite. Fraternity,
by definition, consists in making a sacrifice for others, in
<I>working </I>for the sake of others. When it is free, spontaneous,
voluntary, I understand it, and I applaud it. I admire sacrifice all
the more when it is wholehearted. But when the principle is
proclaimed that fraternity will be imposed by law, that is, in plain
language, that the distribution of the fruits of labor will be made
by legislation, without regard for the rights of labor itself; who
can say to what extent this principle will be applied, what form a
legislator's caprice may assume, what institutions may be decreed
from one day to the next? Now, I question whether any society can
exist under such conditions.</P>

<P>Note that sacrifice, by its very nature, is not, like justice,
something that has a limit. It can extend from the gift of a centime
thrown into the bowl of a beggar to the gift of life itself,<I> usque
ad mortem, mortem autem crucis</I> . <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;"Unto
death, even death on the Cross."-- TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> The
Gospel, which taught men fraternity, has explained it in the counsels
of perfection: "But whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek,
turn to him the other also. And if any man take away thy coat, let
him have thy cloak also." It has done more than explain fraternity to
us; it has given us the most perfect, the most touching, and the most
sublime example at the summit of Golgotha.</P>

<P>Will it, then, be said that legislation and administrative
measures should push the realization of the principle of fraternity
that far? Or will it, rather, stop somewhere along the way? But at
what point will it stop, and according to what rule? This will depend
today on one ballot, tomorrow on another. There is the same
uncertainty in regard to its form. It is a matter of imposing
sacrifices on a few for the sake of all, or on all for the sake of a
few. Who can tell me how the law will go about this? For it cannot be
denied that there are an indefinite number of formulas for achieving
fraternity. Not a day passes that five or six of them do not come to
me in the mail, and all, please observe, completely different. Truly,
is it not madness to believe that a nation can enjoy any peace of
mind or any material prosperity when it is an accepted principle
that, from one day to the next, the legislator can cast the whole
country into whichever one of the hundred thousand fraternitarian
molds he may momentarily prefer?</P>

<P>Let me compare the most important results of each of the two
systems, that recommended by the economists, and that proposed by the
socialists.</P>

<P>First, let us imagine a nation that adopts universal justice as
the basis of its legislation.</P>

<P>Suppose that the citizens say to the government: "We take upon
ourselves the responsibility for our own existence; we shall take
care of our own labor, of our own business, of our own education, of
our own development, of our own religion; your sole function will be
to keep all of us, in all our actions, within the limits of our
rights."</P>

<P>So many things have been tried that I should really like to see my
country, or any country whatever, at least make a trial of this.
Certainly no one can deny that the mechanism is marvelously simple.
Everyone exercises his rights as he pleases, provided that he does
not encroach on the rights of others. The test would be all the more
interesting, since, in point of fact, the nations that come the
closest to this system surpass all the others in security,
prosperity, equality, and dignity. Yes, if I had ten more years to
live, I should willingly give up nine of them to be present for one
year to see such an experiment made in my country. For it seems to me
that I would be the happy witness of the following results:</P>

<P>In the first place, everyone would be sure of his future, at least
in so far as it could be affected by the law. As I have remarked,
exact justice is something so definite that legislation which had
only justice in view would be virtually immutable. It could vary only
as to the means of approaching ever more closely to this single end:
the protection of men's persons and their rights. Thus, everyone
would be able to devote himself to all sorts of honest enterprises
without fear and without uncertainty. All careers would be open to
all; every man would be able to exercise his faculties freely, as
determined by his interests, his inclinations, his aptitudes, or his
circumstances; there would be neither privileges nor monopolies nor
restrictions of any kind.</P>

<P>Moreover, the forces of government would attain this goal all the
better because they would all be applied to preventing and repressing
misrepresentation, fraud, delinquency, crime, and acts of violence,
instead of being dissipated, as at present, among a host of matters
alien to their essential function. Our adversaries themselves will
not deny that to prevent and repress injustice is the principle
function of the state. Why, then, has this precious art of prevention
and repression of injustice made so little progress among us? Because
the state neglects it for the thousand other functions with which it
has been entrusted. For that reason, security is not the distinctive
trait of French society--far from it! It would be complete, however,
under the system that I, for the moment, have undertaken to analyze.
There would be security in regard to the future, since no utopia
could be imposed by borrowing the public police force; there would be
security in the present, since that force would be devoted
exclusively to combatting and abolishing injustice.</P>

<P>Here I must say a word concerning the consequences that security
engenders. In such a situation, property in its diverse forms
--landed, personal, industrial, intellectual, manual--is completely
safe. It is sheltered from the attacks of malefactors and, what is
more, from the attacks of the law. Whatever may be the nature of the
services that the workers render to society or to one another, or
that they exchange abroad, these services will always retain their
<I>natural value. </I>This value will, to be sure, be affected by the
vicissitudes of circumstance, but at least it will never be affected
by the caprices of the law, by the exigencies of taxation, or by
parliamentary intrigues, demands, and influences. The prices of goods
and services will then undergo the minimum possible fluctuation; and,
under these conditions, it will be impossible for industry not to
develop, for wealth not to increase, for capital not to be
accumulated, with prodigious rapidity.</P>

<P>Now, when capital funds are multiplied, there is competition among
them; their remuneration diminishes, or, in other words, the rate of
interest is lowered. It is less and less of a burden on the price of
products. The proportional share of capital in the common product of
labor keeps on decreasing. The tools of production become more widely
diffused as they come within the reach of a greater number of men.
The prices of consumers' goods are reduced by the full amount of
capital's lesser share; the cost of living falls, and this is a
primary prerequisite for the independence of the working
classes.2</P>

<P>At the same time, and as a result of the same cause (the rapid
increase in capital), wages are necessarily raised. Capital, in fact,
yields no return at all unless it is put to work. The more the wages
fund increases, and the more fully it is employed in the payment of a
given number of workers, the higher wages rise.</P>

<P>Thus, the necessary result of this regime of exact justice, and
consequently of liberty and security, is to relieve the suffering
classes in two ways: first, by reducing the cost of living; second,
by raising wage rates.</P>

<P>It is not possible for the condition of the workers to be thus
naturally and doubly improved without a corresponding improvement and
refinement in their moral condition. We are then on the road to
equality. I am not referring only to that equality before the law
which the system evidently implies, since it excludes all injustice,
but also to actual physical and moral equality, resulting from the
fact that the remuneration of labor increases as, and even because,
that of capital decreases. If we glance at the relations of such a
nation with other nations, we find that they are all favorable to
peace. Protecting itself against any aggression is its only policy.
It neither threatens nor is threatened. It has no diplomacy and still
less a diplomacy based on positions of strength. In virtue of the
principle of universal justice, no citizen being able to prevent
another citizen from buying or selling abroad, the commercial
relations of this nation will be free and widespread. No one will
deny that these relations contribute to the maintenance of peace.
They will themselves constitute a veritable and precious system of
defense, which will render arsenals, fortified places, navies, and
standing armies well-nigh useless. Thus, all the energies of this
nation will be applied to productive labor, a new cause of increase
of capital, with all the effects deriving from it.</P>

<P>It is easy to see that in such a nation, the government is reduced
to very limited proportions, and the administrative apparatus to the
utmost simplicity. What does it have to do? To give to the public
police force the sole function of making justice prevail among the
citizens. Now, this can be done with little expense and costs only
twenty-six million francs in France today. Hence, this nation will
not, so to speak, pay taxes. It is even certain that civilization and
progress will tend to make the government more and more simple and
economical, for the more that justice becomes an outgrowth of good
social customs, the more practicable it will be to reduce the force
organized to impose it.</P>

<P>When a nation is burdened with taxes, nothing is more difficult,
and I would say, impossible, than to levy them equally. The
statisticians and fiscal authorities no longer even try to do so.
What is still more difficult, however, is to shift the tax burden
onto the shoulders of the rich. The state can have an abundance of
money only by taking from everyone and especially from the masses.
But in the simple type of regime on behalf of which I have made this
futile plea, a regime that demands only a few dozen million francs,
nothing is easier than an equitable levy. A single tax, proportional
to the amount of property owned, levied on each household and without
expense for the existing machinery of the municipal councils, is
sufficient for the purpose. No more of that tenacious zeal on behalf
of the public treasury, of that devouring bureaucracy, which
constitute the parasites and the vermin of the body politic; no more
of those indirect contributions, of that money wrested by force and
by cunning, of those fiscal traps laid in every avenue of productive
labor, of those shackles which do us even more harm on account of the
liberties that they take away from us than on account of the
resources that they deprive us of.</P>

<P>Do I need to show that order would be the inevitable result of
such a regime? From whence could disorder come? Not from poverty; it
would probably be, at least in its chronic state, unknown in the
country; and if, after all, accidental and transient suffering did
occur, no one would dream of blaming it on the state, the government,
the law. Today, when it is an accepted principle that the function of
the state is to distribute wealth to everybody, it is natural that
the state is held accountable for this commitment. To keep it, it
multiplies taxes and produces more poverty than it cures. With new
demands on the part of the public and new taxes on the part of the
state, we cannot but go from one revolution to another. But if it
were well understood that the state can take from the workers only
what is strictly indispensable to guarantee them against all fraud
and all violence, I cannot perceive from what side disorder would
come.</P>

<P>Some may think that, under a regime so simple, so easily
realizable, society would be very gloomy and sad. What would become
of the great affairs of state? What purpose would statesmen serve?
Would not the national assembly itself, reduced to making
improvements in the Civil Code and the Penal Code, cease to offer to
the avid curiosity of the public the spectacle of its passionate
debates and dramatic struggles?</P>

<P>These singular qualms stem from the idea that government and
society are one and the same thing--as false and harmful an idea as
there ever was. If that identity existed, to simplify government
would be, in fact, to reduce the role of society.</P>

<P>But would the sole fact that the public police force would be
limited to making justice prevail take something away from the
initiative of the citizens? Is their action restricted, even today,
to the limits fixed by the law? Would it not be permissible for them,
provided that they did not exceed the bounds of justice, to form an
infinite number of private organizations and associations of every
nature, religious, charitable, industrial, agricultural,
intellectual, and even phalansterian and Icarian? Is it not certain,
on the contrary, that the abundance of capital would favor all these
enterprises? But each would associate himself with them voluntarily
at his own peril and risk. Those who desire the intervention of the
state want to form these associations at the risk and expense of the
public.</P>

<P>It will no doubt be said: In this regime, we see clearly justice,
economy, freedom, wealth, peace, order, and equality, but not
fraternity.</P>

<P>Once again let us ask ourselves: Is there in the heart of man only
what the legislator has put there? Did fraternity have to make its
appearance on earth by way of the ballot box? Does the law forbid you
to practice charity simply because all that it imposes on you is the
obligation to practice justice? Are we to believe that women will
cease to be self-sacrificing and that pity will no longer find a
place in their hearts because self-sacrifice and pity will not be
commanded by the law? What, then, is the article of the code, which,
wresting a young woman from the arms of her mother, impels her to
serve in those gloomy homes for the aged where the ugly scars of the
body and the still uglier scars of the mind are displayed? What is
the article of the code that determines the vocation of the priest?
To what written law, to what governmental intervention, must we
ascribe the foundation of Christianity, the zeal of the apostles, the
courage of the martyrs, the charity of F&eacute;nelon or of Francis
de Paul, the self-denial of so many men who in our day have risked
their lives a thousand times for the triumph of the people's
cause?3</P>

<P>Every time we deem an action to be good and beautiful, we should
like, quite naturally, to see it made the general practice. Now, when
we see in society a force to which all gives way, our first impulse
is to enlist its aid by decreeing the action and imposing it on
everyone. But the question is whether one does not thereby degrade
both the nature of this force and the nature of the action, rendering
legally obligatory what was essentially spontaneous and voluntary. As
far as I am concerned, I cannot get it into my head that the law,
which is force, can be usefully applied to any purpose other than
repressing wrongs and maintaining rights.</P>

<P>I have just described a nation where this would be the case. Let
us suppose, now, that among the people of this nation the opinion
prevailed that the law should no longer be limited to imposing
justice; that it should aspire further to impose fraternity.</P>

<P>What will happen? It will not take me long to tell, for the reader
has only to remake the preceding picture in reverse.</P>

<P>At first a frightful uncertainty, a deadly insecurity, will hover
over the whole domain of private activity; for fraternity can express
itself in billions of unknown forms and, consequently, billions of
unforeseen decrees. Innumerable proposals will each day come to
threaten all established relations. In the name of fraternity someone
will demand <I>equality of wage rates, </I>whereupon the working
classes will be reduced to the status of Indian castes; neither
ability nor courage nor assiduity nor intelligence will be able to
raise them up again: a leaden law will weigh them down. This world
will be a Dante's inferno to them: <I>Abandon all hope, ye who enter.
</I>In the name of fraternity another will demand that the working
day be reduced to ten, eight, six, four hours; whereupon production
will be forthwith brought to a halt. As there will be no more bread
to appease hunger, nor cloth to protect men against the cold, a third
will propose replacing bread and cloth by legal tender paper money.
Do we not buy things with money? To multiply money, he will say, is
to multiply bread and cloth; to multiply paper is to multiply money.
Q.E.D. A fourth will require that competition be abolished by decree;
a fifth, that self-interest be eliminated by law; this one will want
the state to provide work; that one, education; and another, pensions
for all citizens. Still another would dethrone all the kings on
earth, and decree, in the name of fraternity, universal war. I stop
here. It is quite evident that, if we take this path, the supply of
utopias is inexhaustible. They will be rejected, it will be said.
Granted; but it <I>is possible </I>that they will not be; and this
suffices to create<I> uncertainty, </I>the greatest scourge of
labor.</P>

<P>Under this system, capital cannot be formed. It will be rare,
dear, and concentrated in a few hands. This means that wages will be
reduced, and that inequality will open up a continually widening gulf
between the social classes.</P>

<P>It will not be long before the public finances reach a state of
complete disorder. How could it be otherwise when the state is
responsible for furnishing everything to everybody? The people will
be crushed under the burden of taxes; loan after loan will be
floated; after having drained the present, the state will devour the
future.</P>

<P>Finally, as it will be accepted in principle that the state is
responsible for establishing fraternity on behalf of its citizens, we
shall see the entire people transformed into petitioners. Landed
property, agriculture, industry, commerce, shipping, industrial
companies, all will bestir themselves to claim favors from the state.
The public treasury will be literally pillaged. Everyone will have
good reasons to prove that legal fraternity should be interpreted in
this sense: "Let me have the benefits, and let others pay the costs."
Everyone's effort will be directed toward snatching a scrap of<I>
fraternal</I> privilege from the legislature. The suffering classes,
although having the greatest claim, will not always have the greatest
success; their multitude will, meanwhile, increase constantly, from
which it follows that we can have only one revolution after
another.</P>

<P>In a word, we shall see unfolding before us the whole somber
spectacle whose prologue some modern societies are already
presenting, after having adopted this disastrous idea of <I>legal
fraternity.</I></P>

<P>I have no need to say that this whole concept has its origin in
generous feelings, in disinterested motives. It is just because of
this that it has so rapidly gained the support of the masses, and
also that it is sure to open an abyss under our feet if it proves to
be false.</P>

<P>I add that I shall be happy, for my part, if it proves not to be
false. Good heavens! If universal fraternity can be decreed, and the
sanction of the public police force can be efficaciously given to
this decree; if the motive of self-interest, as Louis Blanc wishes,
can be made to disappear by a mere show of hands; if this article in
the program of<I> peaceful democracy: "No more selfishness!" </I>can
be realized by way of legislation; if it can be arranged that the
state may give everything to everyone, without receiving anything
from anyone; then let it be done by all means. Certainly, I shall
vote for the decree and rejoice that humanity is to attain perfection
and happiness by so short and easy a road.</P>

<P>But it must be said plainly that such conceptions seem to us
chimerical and futile to the point of na&iuml;vet&eacute;. That they
should have raised hopes in the class that labors and suffers and
does not have time for reflection, is not surprising. But how can
they mislead competent political theorists?</P>

<P>These writers believed that the sufferings that overwhelm a great
number of our brethren are imputable to <I>liberty, </I>that is,
justice. They started with the idea that the system of liberty, of
exact justice, had been put to the test legally, and that it had
failed. They concluded from this that the time had come for
legislation to take a further step, and that it should finally be
imbued with the principle of <I>fraternity.</I> Hence these
Saint-Simonian, Fourierist, Communist, Owenist schools of thought;
hence these efforts to mobilize labor; hence these declarations that
the state Owes subsistence, well-being, and education to all its
citizens; that it should be generous, charitable, involved in
everything, devoted to everybody; that its mission is to feed the
infants, instruct the young, assure employment to the able-bodied,
provide pensions for the disabled; in a word, that it should
intervene directly to relieve all suffering, satisfy and anticipate
all wants, furnish capital to all enterprises, enlightenment to all
minds, balm for all wounds, asylums for all the unfortunate, and even
aid, to the point of shedding French blood, for all oppressed people
on the face of the earth.</P>

<P>Who would not like to see all these benefits flow forth upon the
world from the<I> law</I> as from an inexhaustible source? Who would
not be happy to see the state take upon itself every difficulty,
every precaution, every responsibility, every duty, all the laborious
and heavy tasks that Providence, whose designs are impenetrable, has
imposed upon mankind, leaving to the individuals of which it is
composed the attractive and easy path--satisfactions, enjoyments,
certainty, calm, repose, an always assured present, an always smiling
future, wealth without worries, a family without responsibilities,
credit without pledges, a life without effort?</P>

<P>Certainly, we would like to have all this, <I>if it were possible.
</I>But is it possible? That is the question. We cannot understand
what people mean by the state. We believe that there is in this
perpetual personification of the state the strangest and the most
humiliating of mystifications. What, then, is this state that takes
upon itself all virtues, all duties, all acts of munificence? Whence
does it draw those resources that it is urged to dispense by way of
benefits to individuals? Is it not from the individuals themselves?
How, then, can these resources be increased by passing through the
hands of a parasitical and voracious intermediary? Is it not clear,
on the contrary, that the whole apparatus of government is of such a
nature as to absorb many useful resources and to reduce the share of
the workers proportionately? Is it not also evident that the latter
will thereby lose a part of their freedom, along with a part of their
well-being?</P>

<P>From whatever point of view I consider human law, I cannot see
that anything other than justice can be reasonably demanded of
it.</P>

<P>Suppose it is asked to concern itself with matters of religion,
for example. Certainly, it would be desirable that there should be
only one creed, one faith, one form of worship in the world, provided
it were the <I>true faith. </I>But, however desirable unity may be,
diversity, that is to say, inquiry and discussion, is even more worth
while, until such time as the infallible sign whereby this <I>true
faith is </I>to be recognized shines forth for all men to see. The
intervention of the state, even under the pretext of fraternity,
would, then, be an act of oppression, an<I> injustice, </I>if it
sought to establish unity; for who can be sure that the state would
not, unconsciously perhaps, work to stifle truth to the advantage of
error? Unity should result from the universal consent of free
convictions and from the natural attraction that truth exercises over
men's minds. All that can be demanded of the law, then, is liberty
for all beliefs, no matter what intellectual anarchy would result.
For what does this anarchy prove? That unity comes, not at the
beginning, but at the end, of intellectual evolution. It is not a
point of departure; it is a point of culmination. A law that would
impose it would be unjust; and if justice does not necessarily imply
fraternity, at least it will be agreed that fraternity excludes
injustice.</P>

<P>The same is true of education. Obviously, if people could agree on
the best possible kind of education, in regard to both content and
method, a uniform system of public instruction would be preferable,
since error would, in that case, be necessarily excluded by law. But
as long as such a criterion has not been found, as long as the
legislator and the Minister of Public Education do not carry on their
persons an unquestionable sign of infallibility, the true method has
the best chance of being discovered and of displacing the others if
room is left for diversity, trial and error, experimentation, and
individual efforts guided by a self-regarding <I>interest in the
outcome-- </I>in a word, where there is freedom. The chances are
worst in a uniform system of education established by decree, for in
such a system error is permanent, universal, and irremediable.
Therefore, those who, in the name of fraternity, demand that the
<I>law </I>determine what shall be taught and impose this on everyone
should realize that they are running the risk of having the law
direct and impose the teaching of nothing but error; for legal
interdiction can pervert the truth by perverting the minds that
believe they have possession of it. Now, is it, I ask, fraternity, in
the true sense of the word, that has recourse to force to impose, or
at least to run the risk of imposing, error on mankind? Diversity is
feared; it is stigmatized as anarchy. But it results necessarily from
the very diversity of men's opinions and convictions, a diversity
that tends, besides, to disappear with discussion, study, and
experience. In the meanwhile, what claim has one system to prevail
over any other by law or force? Here again we find that this
pretended fraternity, which invokes the law or legal constraint, is
in opposition to justice.</P>

<P>I could make the same observation about the press, and, in fact, I
hardly understand why those who demand a uniform system of state
education do not demand a uniform state press. For the press is also
a kind of education. The press admits discussion, since it lives by
it. There too, then, is diversity and anarchy. Why not, accordingly,
create a Ministry of Publicity and give over to its charge all the
books and all the newspapers in France? Either the state is
infallible, and we can do no better than to let it take entire
control over men's minds; or it is not, and in that case it is no
more reasonable to turn education over to it than the press.</P>

<P>If I consider our foreign relations, I see no other prudent, sound
rule, acceptable to all--such, in short, that it could become a
<I>law </I>--than justice. To submit these relations to the principle
of legal, forced fraternity, is to decree perpetual, universal war;
for it is to assume the obligation of putting our power, the blood
and the wealth of our citizens, at the service of whoever claims them
in order to serve a cause that excites the sympathy of the
legislator. A strange kind of fraternity, indeed! A long time ago
Cervantes personified its ridiculous vanity.</P>

<P>But it is above all in regard to labor that the dogma of
fraternity seems to me to be dangerous, when, contrary to the idea
that constitutes the very essence of that sacred word, people dream
of inserting it into our legal codes, to the accompaniment of the
penal provisions that sanction all positive law.</P>

<P>Fraternity always implies devotion and sacrifice; that is why it
commands our heartfelt admiration. If one says, as do certain
socialists, that acts of fraternal devotion are <I>profitable </I>to
their author, then they do not have to be decreed; men have no need
of a law to persuade them to make profits. Besides, this point of
view greatly degrades and tarnishes the idea of fraternity.</P>

<P>Let us, then, respect its essential character, which is comprised
in these words:<I> Voluntary sacrifice determined by fraternal
feeling.</I></P>

<P>If you make of fraternity a matter of legal prescription, whose
acts are set forth in advance and rendered obligatory by the
industrial code, what remains of this definition? Nothing but
sacrifice; but involuntary, forced sacrifice, exacted by fear of
punishment. And, in all honesty, what is a sacrifice of this nature,
imposed upon one man for the profit of another? Is it an example of
fraternity? No, it is an act of injustice; one must say the word: it
is a form of legal plunder, the worst kind of plunder, since it is
systematic, permanent, and unavoidable.</P>

<P>What did Barb&egrave;s <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Armand Barb&egrave;s
(1809-1870). follower of Babeuf and organizer, in 1838, with Louis
Blanqui and Martin Bernard, of the "Society of the Seasons," which
attempted an unsuccessful insurrection in 1839. The death sentence
pronounced upon him for his part in this affair was commuted to life
imprisonment, but he was liberated by the Revolution of 1848 and died
in voluntary exile.--TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT> do, when, at the session
of May 15, he decreed a tax of a billion francs on behalf of the
suffering classes? He put your principle into practice. This is so
true that the proclamation of Sobrier, <FONT SIZE="-2">&#91;Marie
Joseph Sobrier (1825-1854), editor, in collaboration with George
Sand, Eugene Sue, and others, of La <I>Commune de Paris, journal du
citoyen Sobrier, moniteur des clubs, des corporations, d'ouviers et
de l'arm&egrave;e, </I>a daily newspaper that began publication in
May, 1848, and ceased at the end of September, 1849.--
TRANSLATOR.&#93;</FONT>which concluded like the speech of
Barb&egrave;s, is preceded by this preamble: "Considering that
fraternity must be more than an empty word, that it must be
manifested by deeds, be it decreed: the capitalists, known as such,
will contribute, etc."</P>

<P>What right do you who protest have to blame Barb&egrave;s and
Sobrier? What have they done, except to be a little more logical than
you and to push your own principle a little further?</P>

<P>I say that whenever this principle is introduced into legislation,
even though it may make only a timid appearance at first, it soon
paralyzes capital and labor; for there is no guarantee that it will
not be extended indefinitely. Are so many arguments necessary, then,
to demonstrate that when men are no longer certain of enjoying the
fruit of their labor, they do not work at all or work less?
Insecurity, as is well known, is the principal agent of paralysis in
the case of capital. It drives capital away and prevents it from
being formed; and what will then become of the very classes whose
sufferings are supposed thereby to be relieved? I sincerely believe
that this alone is cause enough to make the most prosperous nation
fall in a short time below the level of Turkey.</P>

<P>Sacrifice imposed on some on behalf of others, by the operation of
the tax laws, evidently loses the character of fraternity. Who, then,
deserves credit for it? Is it the legislator? It costs him nothing
but the effort of casting his ballot. Is it the tax collector? He
obeys out of fear of being removed from office. Is it the taxpayer?
He pays reluctantly. Who, then, deserves the credit that
self-sacrifice implies? Where is its morality to be found?</P>

<P>Illegal plunder fills everyone with aversion; it turns against
itself all the forces of public opinion and puts them on the side of
justice. Legal plunder, on the contrary, is perpetrated without
troubling the conscience, and this cannot fail to weaken the moral
fibre of a nation.</P>

<P>With courage and prudence, a man can protect himself from illegal
plunder, but no one can escape from legal plunder. If someone tries,
what is the distressing spectacle presented to society? A plunderer
armed with the law, a victim resisting the law.</P>

<P>When, under the pretext of fraternity, the legal code imposes
mutual sacrifices on the citizens, human nature is not thereby
abrogated. Everyone will then direct his efforts toward contributing
little to, and taking much from, the common fund of sacrifices. Now,
is it the most unfortunate who gain in this struggle? Certainly not,
but rather the most influential and calculating.</P>

<P>Are union, concord, and harmony at least the results of fraternity
thus understood? Oh, undoubtedly, fraternity is the divine chain
whose links will ultimately unite individuals, families, nations, and
races; but it will do so only by remaining what it is, that is, the
most free, the most spontaneous, the most voluntary, the most
meritorious, the most religious of sentiments. It is not its
counterfeit that will accomplish this prodigy; legal plunder may
borrow the name of fraternity, as well as its appearance, its
formulas, and its insignia, but it will never be anything but a
principle of discord, confusion, unjust claims, terror, misery,
inertia, and animosity.</P>

<P>We are presented with a serious objection. We are told: It is
indeed true that freedom, equality before the law, is justice. But
strict justice remains neutral between the rich and the poor, the
strong and the weak, the wise and the ignorant, the property owner
and the proletarian, the fellow countryman and the foreigner. Now,
<I>men's interests being naturally antagonistic, </I>to allow men
their freedom with only just laws intervening between them is to
sacrifice the poor, the weak, the ignorant, the proletarian, the
gladiator who enters the arena unarmed.</P>

<P>"What could result," says M. Consid&eacute;rant,</P>

<P><FONT SIZE="-1">from that industrial liberty on which so much
reliance had been placed, from the famous principle of <I>free
competition, </I>which was believed to be so eminently democratic in
character? Nothing could come of it save the general enslavement, the
collective enfeoffment, of the masses, deprived of capital, of
industrial arms, of the tools of production, and, above all, of
education, by the class that is industrially supplied and well
equipped. We are told: "The lists are open; every individual is free
to enter the fray; the conditions are equal for all the combatants."
Very good. Only one thing is forgotten--that on this great
battlefield some are trained, disciplined, equipped, armed to the
teeth, that they have in their possession a vast store of provisions,
materiel, munitions, and engines of war, that they occupy all the
strategic positions; and that others, plundered, destitute, ignorant,
and hungry, are obliged, in order to live from day to day and keep
their wives and children alive, to implore their <I>adversaries</I>
themselves for any kind of work whatever at a meager wage.4</FONT>
What! Industry compared to war! These arms, which are called capital,
which consist of provisions of all kinds, and which can never be
employed except in the conquest of rebellious Nature, are compared,
by virtue of a deplorable sophism, to those bloodstained arms which
men turn against one another on the battlefield! Indeed, it is only
too easy to derogate the industrial order, when the whole vocabulary
of warfare is borrowed in order to decry it.</P>

<P>The profound, irreconcilable disagreement on this point between
socialists and economists consists in this: The socialists believe
that men's interests are essentially antagonistic. The economists
believe in the natural harmony, or rather in the necessary and
progressive harmonization, of men's interests. This is the whole
difference.</P>

<P>Starting from the premise that men's interests are naturally
antagonistic, the socialists are led, by logical necessity, to seek
an <I>artificial </I>organization of these conflicting interests or
even to stifle, if they can, the feeling of self-interest in the
heart of man. This is what they tried to do at the Luxembourg. But if
they are mad enough to try, they are not strong enough to succeed;
and it goes without saying that, after having declaimed against
individualism in their books, they collect royalties on these books
and conduct themselves quite like everyone else in the ordinary
affairs of life.</P>

<P>To be sure, if men's interests are naturally antagonistic, we must
trample underfoot justice, liberty, and equality before the law. We
must remake the world, or, as they say, <I>reconstitute society,
</I>according to one of the numerous plans that they never stop
inventing. For self-interest, a disorganizing principle, there must
be substituted legal, imposed, involuntary, forced<I>
self-sacrifice-- </I>in a word, organized plunder; and as this new
principle can only arouse infinite aversion and resistance, an
attempt will be made at first to get it accepted under the deceptive
name of fraternity, after which the law, which is force, will be
invoked.</P>

<P>But if Providence is not mistaken, if it has arranged things in
such a way that men's interests, under the law of justice, tend to
adjust themselves naturally in the most harmonious way; if, in the
words of M. de Lamartine, they achieve, under a regime of liberty, a
justice that no amount of despotism could produce for them; if
equality of rights is the most certain, the most direct means toward
actual equality; then, we can ask of the law nothing but justice,
liberty, and equality, just as only the removal of obstacles is
needed for each of the drops of water that form the ocean to find its
own level.</P>

<P>And this is precisely the conclusion at which political economy
arrives. It does not set out in search of this conclusion; it comes
upon it. But it rejoices at finding it; for is it not ultimately a
great satisfaction for the mind to see harmony in liberty, when
others are reduced to demanding it by way of arbitrary measures?</P>

<P>The reproachful words that the socialists often address to us are
very strange indeed! If, unfortunately, we have fallen into error,
should they not deplore it? What do we say? We say: After mature
consideration, it must be recognized that what God has done He has
done well, so that the best chance of progress lies in justice and
liberty.</P>

<P>The socialists believe us to be in error; that is their right. But
they should at least be distressed by it; for our error, if it be
demonstrated, implies the urgency of substituting the artificial for
the natural, despotism for liberty, a contingent and human invention
for the eternal and divine conception.</P>

<P>Suppose that a professor of chemistry were to say: "The world is
threatened by a great catastrophe; God has not taken proper
precautions. I have analyzed the air that comes from human lungs, and
I have come to the conclusion that it is not fit to breathe; so that,
by calculating the volume of the atmosphere, I can predict the day
when it will be entirely polluted, and when mankind will die of
consumption, unless it adopts an artificial mode of respiration of my
invention."</P>

<P>Another professor steps forward and says: "No, mankind will not
perish thus. It is true that the air that has already served to
sustain animal life is vitiated for that purpose; but it is fit for
plant life, and what plants exhale is favorable to human respiration.
An incomplete study has induced some to think that God made a
mistake; a more exact inquiry shows a harmonious design in His
handiwork. Men can continue to breathe as Nature willed it."</P>

<P>What should we say if the first professor overwhelmed the second
with abuse, saying: "You are a chemist with a cold, hard, dried-up
heart; you preach the horrible doctrine of<I> laissez faire; </I>you
do not love mankind, since you demonstrate the uselessness of my
respiratory apparatus."</P>

<P>This is the sum and substance of our quarrel with the socialists.
Both they and we desire harmony. They seek it in the innumerable
schemes that they want the law to impose on men; we find it in the
nature of men and things.</P>

<P>This would be the place to demonstrate that men's interests tend
toward harmony, for that is the whole question; but this would
require a course in political economy, and the reader will have to
excuse me for the moment from undertaking such a tasks.5 I shall say
just this: If political economy attains to the insight that men's
interests are harmonious, it does so because it does not stop, as
socialism does, at the immediate consequences of phenomena, but goes
on to their eventual and ultimate effects. This is the whole secret.
The two schools differ exactly as the two chemists of whom I have
just spoken: one sees the part, and the other the whole. For example,
when the socialists are willing to take pains to follow the results
of competition to the end, that is, to the consumer, instead of
stopping at the producer, they will see that it is the most powerful
agent for equality and progress, whether at home or abroad. And it is
because political economy finds harmony in this ultimate effect that
it says: In my domain, <I>there is much to learn, and little to do.
</I>Much to learn, because the concatenation of effects can be
followed only with great application; little to do, since the harmony
of the whole phenomenon is derived from the ultimate effect. I
happened to discuss this question with the eminent gentleman whom the
Revolution lifted to such great heights. I said to him: "Only justice
can be demanded from the law, which acts by means of coercion."</P>

<P>He thought that people can, in addition, expect fraternity from
the law. Last August he wrote me: "If ever, in a time of crisis, I
find myself placed at the helm, your idea will be half of my
creed."</P>

<P>And I reply to him here: "The second half of your creed will
stifle the first, for you cannot legislate fraternity without
legislating injustice."6</P>

<P>In closing, I will say to the socialists: If you believe that
political economy rejects association, organization, and fraternity,
you are in error.</P>

<P>Association! Do you not know that this is society itself,
ceaselessly perfecting itself?</P>

<P>Organization! Do you not know that this is what makes all the
difference there is between a congeries of heterogeneous elements and
the masterpieces of Nature?</P>

<P>Fraternity! Do you not know that this is to justice what the warm
impulses of the heart are to the cold calculations of the mind?</P>

<P>We are in agreement with you. We applaud your effort to
disseminate among mankind a seed that will bear fruit in the
future.</P>

<P>But we are opposed to you from the moment that you have law and
taxation, that is, coercion and plunder, intervene; for besides the
fact that this resort to force shows that you have more faith in
yourselves than in the genius of mankind, it is enough for us to see
that you propose to tamper with Nature herself and to impair the very
essence of that fraternity which you seek to realize.7</P>

   between a business transaction and an act of pure benevolence. I
   have sometimes had the pleasure of seeing in action the most
   charitable man, the most devout heart, the most fraternal soul
   that I know. The priest of my village carries to a rare degree of
   self-sacrifice the love of his neighbor and particularly of the
   poor. This goes so far that when, in order to come to the aid of
   the poor there is need of getting money from the rich, this honest
   man is not very scrupulous about his choice of means. He had given
   shelter in his home to a seventy-year-old nun, one of those who
   had been displaced by the Revolution. To provide an hour of
   distraction to his lodger, my friend, who had never touched a
   card, learned to play piquet; and you should have seen him pretend
   to be enthusiastic about the game, so that the nun would think
   that she was being useful to her benefactor. This went on for
   fifteen years. But here is what transformed an act of simple
   condescension into a veritable act of heroism: the good nun was
   devoured by a cancer, which gave off around her a horrible stench,
   of which she was never conscious. Now, it was noted that the cure
   never took tobacco during the game for fear of making known to the
   poor invalid her sad condition. How many people were given the
   cross of the Legion of Honor this past May Day who are incapable
   of doing for a single day anything as heroic as my old priest did
   for fifteen years! Well, I have observed this priest, and I can
   avow that, when he made a bargain, he was as vigilant as any
   honest Paris merchant. He defended his own interest in the matter
   of weight, measure, quality, and price, and considered himself in
   no wise bound to mix charity and fraternity in a business
   transaction. Let us take away, then, from this word

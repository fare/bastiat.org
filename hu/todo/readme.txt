TODO: these html files need to be incorporated into the bastiat.org
doc framework.

things disappear from the web, so let's just add the unprocessed
original html's into this directory (and git branch), to serve as
backups. some of these i had to fetch from archive.org
already. luckily i had foresight to make sure they are stored there,
but who knows how long before the purge reaches archive.org... so,
here we are.
